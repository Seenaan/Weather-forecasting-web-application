## About

Weather App is a web-based weather forecasting application that fetches and displays weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides current weather conditions, a 7-day forecast, and dynamically updates the background based on the weather condition.

This project was inspired by a deep fascination with weather patterns and a desire to create a practical application that provides real-time weather updates in an engaging way. It started as a personal exploration into integrating weather APIs with web technologies and evolved into a full-fledged weather forecasting application.

As a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, this application showcases skills in web development, API integration, and UI/UX design. It's a testament to the journey of learning and applying knowledge in a meaningful project.
